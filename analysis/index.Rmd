[Models and methods](genash.pdf).

Application examples:

- ASH with log-F likelihood (FASH): [Use FASH to analyze the stem cell gene expression data (Burrows data).](stem.html)

- ASH with binomial likelihood: [Use binomial ASH to compare bulk RNA-seq vs scRNA-seq data.](bulk_single.html)

- ASH with Poisson likelihood: [Gene expression distribution deconvolution for scRNA-seq data](sc.pdf).
